## A twitter clone page 

This is a twitter clone page, only the LogIn and register section, you can register in google and I simulate a data base in JS. The apple LogIn is only visual.
for now is only the register and logIn section im working on the User principal page. 

NOTE: this is a fake data, only the twiiter Nelson data base email and username twitter is mine if you want to follow me there

A data for google:
  ezequieln@gmail
  password: todoNada#56
  
A data for twitter:
  email: ezequieln_@hotmail.com
  twitter User Name: @ezequieln4590
  password: example#1
  
  
  You can create a google account and will be add to the fake data base, and the use it to continue with a google account if you recharge the page it will be erase
  
  NOTE: Im working with the principal user page, some details in the creation of the twitter and in the google register account are missing(The details to put your
  twitter preferences). And will be finish after complete the principal page.
